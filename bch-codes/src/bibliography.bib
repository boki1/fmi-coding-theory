    abstract = {A general method of constructing error correcting binary group codes is obtained. A binary group code with n places, k of which are information places is called an (n,k) code. An explicit method of constructing t-error correcting (n,k) codes is given for n = 2m−1 and k = 2m−1−R(m,t) ≧ 2m−1−mt where R(m,t) is a function of m and t which cannot exceed mt. An example is worked out to illustrate the method of construction.}

    abstract="A class of powerful multiple-error-correcting cyclic codes was discovered by Bose and Ray-Chaudhuri in 1960 [1] and independently by Hocquenghem in 1959 [2]. These codes are known as the BCH codes. The BCH codes provide a wide variety of block lengths and corresponding code rates. They are important not only because of their flexibility in the choice of their code parameters, but also because, at block lengths of a few hundred or less, many of these codes are among the most used codes of the same lengths and code rates. Another advantage is that there exists very elegant and powerful algebraic decoding algorithms for the BCH codes. The importance of the BCH codes also stems from the fact that they are capable of correcting all random patterns of t errors by a decoding algorithm that is both simple and easily realized in a reasonable amount of equipment. BCH codes occupy a prominent place in the theory and practice of multiple-error correction.",

abstract="Given that the NAND FlashNAND flashmemory is not a very reliable medium, it follows that a Solid State Disk needs some help to achieve a reliability suitable for computing applications: the Error Correction Code (ECC). As the NAND technology scales down, ECC becomes a critical design topic. This chapter deals with BCHBCH, the most common ECC in solid state disks. Two main issues arise when an ECC is used inside an SSD. First of all, the ECC should not limit the bandwidth, being the bottleneck of the entire drive: this translates in a hardware implementation that needs to handle multiple devices (channel) in parallelParallel BCH. At the same time, ECC must avoid erroneous corrections when the error correction capabilityCorrection capabilityof the code is overcome, iI/O operations per second (IOPS).e. it must have a high detectionDetectionproperty. In this chapter the ECC definitions are reviewed, then the BCHBCHcode is presented along with the multi-channelMulti-channeltopic. Finally, BCHBCHand LDPCLow-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codesdetectionDetectionproperty are discussed.",
